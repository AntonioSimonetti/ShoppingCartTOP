**Shopping Cart**

This is a web store created as a project for The Odin Project curriculum.

**Live Version**

A live version of the project can be accessed here:https://antoniosimonetti.github.io/ShoppingCartTOP/

**Benefits**

it helped me to gain confidence in using React and React Testing Library and improve my knowledge of the technology.

**Features**

This website is made using fakestoreapi, to simulate an e-commerce. You can add and remove items from the shopping cart and you can open a single product to see more details about the item.
I'm not totally happy about the design of the website but its ok because is just an exercise.


The following technologies were used to build this app:

**HTML<br>
CSS<br>
JavaScript<br>
React<br>
React Testing Library <br>**
